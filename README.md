# Fitness Tracker
This Fitness Tracker project has been made to demonstrate my skills using matplotlib and pandas. It shows the number of steps walked on a daily basis and the gym details where it shows the duration of each gym activity done on a particular day. Finally, the pie chart shows the percentage of time given to each activity on a single day.
